# Columbia University Coding Bootcamp - NoSQL Challenge: Social Network API 

# Description
This project acts as a simple API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. It leverages Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.


# Demo
The following demonstrates how to create a user (post) and then get all users (get):
```/api/users/```


The following demonstrates how to get a user by id (get), update that user by id (put), and delete a user by id (delete):
```/api/users/:id/```


The following demonstrates how to add a friend by user id (post) and delete a friend by user id (delete):
```/api/users/:userId/friends/:friendId/```


The following demonstrates how to create a thought by user id (post) and get all thoughts (get):
```/api/thoughts/:userId```
```/api/thoughts/```


The following demonstrates how to get a thought by id (get), update a thought by id (put), and delete a thought by id (delete):
```/api/thoughts/:id```


The following demonstrates how to add a reaction by thought id (post) and delete a reaction by thought id and reaction id (delete):
